    "#   The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of binding data and functions that operate on that data within a single unit, called a Class. The Class provides a level of abstraction and protects the data from external access, which helps to ensure that the data is accessed and modified only through the methods provided by the Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a Class to inherit the properties and behavior of another Class, called the Parent or Super Class. The Child or Sub Class can then add or modify the properties and behavior of the Parent Class, which promotes code reusability and reduces code redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a Sub Class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its Parent Class. Method overloading allows a Class to have multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding complex implementation details from the user and presenting only the essential features or functionalities. Abstraction can be achieved in OOP through the use of abstract Classes and interfaces. An abstract Class is a Class that cannot be instantiated and must be inherited by its Sub Classes, which then provide a specific implementation of its methods. An interface is a collection of abstract methods that define a contract for the behavior of a Class, without providing an implementation.\n",
